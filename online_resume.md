##### 2. Data Analytics Internship at **The Shaadi Times** [May/2020 - Jun/2020]
> I scraped the data from the Internet for Pre-Corona and Post-Corona phase. After that, I did the data analysis using descriptive statistics. In this analysis, I took different location data to find the impact of COVID19 on air pollution. The results were very unexpected and very good. The whole pollutants were decreased to a greater extent. I also did an analysis of what solution can be taken into consideration for a healthy environment.
